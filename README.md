**What is the Serverless Framework?**
The Serverless Framework makes it easy to build applications using AWS Lambda. It is multi-provider framework, which means you can use it to build Serverless applications using other providers as well. For AWS, Serverless relies on CloudFormation to do the provisioning. It also scaffolds the project structure and takes care of deploying functions.

**Getting Started with the Serverless Framework**
To install Serverless on your machine, run the below mentioned npm command.

`$ npm install serverless -g`
This will install Serverless command-line on your machine. You can use sls alias instead of typing serverless as well.

Now, we will build the application in a step by step manner.
